                A quote by Monkey D Luffy </small>

        <h3 id="sub-title">Who is Monkey D. Luffy</h3>
        <p id="tribute-info">
            Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main
            protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captaion of the increasingly 
            infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream
            is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger.
            He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. 
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info">
            Born in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body
            into rubber. He met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who is a powerful and well known pirate, he ended up giving
            Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as
            a promise for them to meet again someday. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="sub-title">Luffy's personality as a character</h3>
        <p id="tribute-info">Luffy's most dominant traits are his apparent lack of common sense, his utter fearlessness and unwavering
            belief in himself. He generally marches at the beat of his own drum, unwilling to approach anything in a 
            delicate or nuanced matter. That said, Luffy has a penchant of being able to see through the heart of the
            matter, often able to accurately call out someone's personal flaws such as Koby's ( a kid he meets in the
            first episode who had been kidnapped) cowardly nauture. He is profoundly ambitious, frequently declaring he
            will become the Pirate King and devoting his entire becoming one. 
        </p>
        <P id="tribute-info">Luffy's personality can be described as childlike, in the sense that he tends to go to the extremes. He can 
            either be extremely greedy, especially in cases of food, who his crew is, and adventure; or extraordinarily
            selfless, going so far as to virtually sacrifice himself to avenge or protect his friends, crew, and family.
            This childish mentality does not prevent him from often getting to the root of the problem, and allowing him
            to figure out the most simple way of solving it. 
        </P>
        <p id="tribute-info"> Above all else, Luffy dislikes weak people, though not strictly in a physical sense. He has openly told Koby
            that he "hates people like him" due to Koby's frequent use of phrases of "it's impossible" and his cowardly nature.
            Conversely, he likes people who put in the effort to make something of themselves, despite their limitations, 
            and has come to appreciate Koby after seeing him put his life on the line.
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info"> <small id="Quotes"> " I don't want to hear where the treasure is!!! I don't want to know if the treasure exists or not! I don't
            know for sure now, but... everyone out there is risking their lives for it!!! If Rayleigh (The vice captain of the
            previous King of the Pirates) tells us anything about it right now, I'll quit being a pirate! I'll never go on
            an adventure that isn't any fun!!! " 
            -Luffy speaks out against learning what One Piece is from Rayleigh
        </small> 
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info">
        Luffy has a profound thirst for adventure, having described it as his main reason for him wanting to become a Pirate 
        King. Luffy believes the Pirate King is the person with the most freedom in the world, with the ability to travel
        anywhere on the ocean. Luffy rejects becoming anyone's ruler or boss, as he wishes to be free to do whatever he wants, 
        though this never comes at the cost of anyone else's freedom.

        <h3 id="sub-title"> Why I adore Monkey D. Luffy</h3>
        <p id="tribute-info"> I discovered the show as a 10 year old kid, and at the time he became my role model. He lived a life that he was always
            happy with, he lived not worried about what people had to say or think of him, only focusing on he's dreams and goals, which
            made me wanna be like him. The first quote I stated under his picture is a simple sentence but has a deeper meaning when you 
            look carefully. How important are your dreams; are you willing to risk you life for them? During the very first episode of One Piece
            , Luffy tells the future marine, Colby he is a pirate. He later adds he want to be the Pirate King. Colby addresses Luffy, 
            by going down this road, he will be considered a threat to the marines and the World Government. 
            He will also never be able to live a normal life, but Luffy is fine with that. That's how important his dream is. In this qutote, 
            Luffy is teaching us that you should be willing to give up everything for your ambitions, even your life. 
        </p>
        <p id="tribute-info">That quote hit me hard, and really made me appreciate how true his words are, that dreams are only dreams unless you are willing 
            to give up everything for your dreams and ambitions, sometimes even your life. I had goals and dreams, I often used to give up on my goals 
            for the simple reason that I cared about what other people had to say, but after learning from him, I simple focused on my goals. 
            The more you watch this show the more you learn, about him, and other amazing crew members, and all have something to teach that you
            can learn from and apply in your life in some way or form.
